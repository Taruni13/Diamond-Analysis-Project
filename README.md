# 💎 Diamond Analysis Project

This project analyzes diamond pricing in relation to the **4Cs** — **Carat weight, Cut, Color, and Clarity** — using data from leading online diamond vendors. The study compares **natural vs. lab-grown diamonds** and builds predictive regression models to understand the most influential factors in diamond pricing.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Course:** MSBA 210 – Business Analytics  
- **Instructor:** Dr. Chong Huang, Ph.D.  
- **Contributors:** Taruniben Atodariya, Aditi Kadam, Preet Sanandiya  

The main objective was to:
- Build a **regression model** to predict diamond prices using the 4Cs.  
- Compare **natural diamonds** with **lab-grown diamonds**.  
- Create a **Rapaport-style report** for diamonds sized between **0.70 and 0.89 carats**.  
- Visualize pricing patterns with dashboards, pivot tables, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- **Descriptive Statistics** – Mean, range, mode, standard deviation, quartiles.  
- **Pivot Tables** – For natural vs. lab-grown diamond comparisons.  
- **Heatmaps** – Visual comparison with Rapaport report.  
- **Regression Models** – Price prediction based on 4Cs.  
- **Scatter Plots** – Relationship between carat and price.  
- **Dashboards** – Interactive visualization with bar charts and cluster column charts.

## 📈 Findings
- **Carat weight** is the strongest determinant of price.  
- Followed by: **Cut → Color → Clarity**.  
- **Lab-grown diamonds** are significantly cheaper than natural ones, though the gap is narrowing.  
- Visualization tools (pivot tables, scatter plots, heatmaps) revealed hidden trends and market differences.
